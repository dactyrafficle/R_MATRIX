# R_MATRIX

making an object to display matrices and some common operations


the main objectives

  the have matrices that look nice 
  compute the inverse, solve linear systems cleanly 
  highlight rows, columns, cells 
  show the expanded determinant by any row/column 
  show the unevaluated cofactor matrix 
  show the matrix of minors 
  show multiplications 

on language 

  compute will solve numerically 
  show will be everything else (ie. showBMatrix(), showExpandedDeterminant() etc.
